# Python Unicode Data Localization

This project aims to generate a Python module which provides translations for
the Unicode descriptions found in the
[`unicodedata` module](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html). The source
of the translations is [symbl.cc](https://symbl.cc) which has
its source code at
[GitHub](https://github.com/unicode-table/unicode-table-data). From this, PO and
MO files are generated by this project.

**Note:** these are also useful for other programming languages. An overview of
supported language can be found
[here](https://github.com/OpenTaal/unicode-table-data/blob/master/tools/overview.md).

This localization has been discussed in:
* https://bugs.python.org/issue34053
* https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2018-July/051889.html
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/python-ideas/g2jj4WRVDFA


## Prerequisits

Install the following packages

    sudo apt-get install wget unzip python3 gettext


## Generating

In order to generate the files needed for a Python module with translations of
Unicode descriptions, run

    ./1-clean.sh

which will remove previous generations. Then run

    ./2-download.sh

to download the translations in `master.zip`. These are unzipped with

    ./3-extract.sh

into the directory `unicode-table-data-master`. The Python script

    ./4-generate.py

will generate PO files in a tree in the directory [`locale`](locale), such as
* `cn`
    * `LC_MESSAGES`
        * [`symbols.po`](locale/cn/LC_MESSAGES/symbols.po)
* `de`
    * `LC_MESSAGES`
        * [`symbols.po`](locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/symbols.po)
* `fr`
    * `LC_MESSAGES`
        * [`symbols.po`](locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES/symbols.po)
* ...

This script will also write log messages on information, warnings and errors to
the command line. Note that languages are skipped if less than 1% has been
translated or 10% of the translations identical to the original text.

Also, warnings are show when source texts are identical. This happens for
`<Control>` and many ideographs and needs to be looked at further as the source
texts need to be unique for PO files.

The PO files can be converted to MO files by running

    ./5-convert.sh

This results in the following files in the directory `locale`
* `cn`
    * `LC_MESSAGES`
        * `symbols.po`
        * `symbols.mo`
* `de`
    * `LC_MESSAGES`
        * `symbols.po`
        * `symbols.mo`
* `fr`
    * `LC_MESSAGES`
        * `symbols.po`
        * `symbols.mo`
* ...


## Distribution

The files in `locale` can be packaged and distributed via e.g. PyPI or
eventually become part of the Python distribution. Note that this
localization can also be used for other programming languages.


## Copyright
